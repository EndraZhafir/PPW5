        <h2>About Radiohead</h2>
        <p>
            Radiohead is a British rock band that originated in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985.
            The group consists of Thom Yorke as the lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist,
            Jonny Greenwood handling guitar, keyboards, and various other instruments,
            his brother Colin Greenwood on bass, Ed O'Brien contributing guitar and
            backing vocals, and Philip Selway on drums and percussion. Since 1994,
            they have collaborated with producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist
            Stanley Donwood. Known for their experimental style, Radiohead has
            played a significant role in shaping alternative rock.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1991, Radiohead signed a contract with EMI and introduced their first album,
            Pablo Honey, in 1993. Their breakout single, "Creep," gained international
            success, helping establish their reputation. The release of The Bends in
            1995 further elevated their status, both in popularity and critical
            acclaim. Their third album, OK Computer (1997), became a landmark
            in modern music, praised for its intricate production and its
            exploration of themes like isolation in contemporary society.
        </p>

        <p>
            With their fourth album, Kid A (2000), Radiohead took a bold creative turn by
            incorporating elements of electronic music, jazz, classical compositions,
            and krautrock. While the album initially divided opinions, many later
            regarded it as the greatest record of the 2000s. The band followed it
            up with Amnesiac (2001), which was recorded during the same sessions.
            Their last album with EMI, Hail to the Thief (2003), combined rock
            with electronic elements and featured lyrics influenced by the
            global political climate, particularly the war on terror.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2007, Radiohead made history by releasing their seventh album, In Rainbows,
            as a digital download with a pay-what-you-want pricing model. The move was 
            both a critical and commercial success. Their next album, The King of Limbs
            (2011), was heavily focused on rhythm, making extensive use of looping and
            sampling techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016), prominently featured orchestral
            arrangements composed by Jonny Greenwood. Beyond their work with Radiohead,
            various band members have pursued solo projects, with Yorke, Jonny Greenwood,
            Selway, and O'Brien each releasing their own music. In 2021, Yorke and Jonny
            Greenwood introduced a new musical project called The Smile, further expanding
            their artistic reach.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Averone (real name is on the footer). I am currently a student at
            Gadjah Mada University Vocational School, majoring in Software Engineering.
            I was born in Bekasi on April 30, 2006, but I have spent the majority of my life in Yogyakarta.
        </p>

        <p>
            My fascination with software engineering began in my childhood, sparked by my experiences playing games
            on an old computer. Despite its limitations, that computer opened the door to a world of possibilities, igniting my
            curiosity about how technology works. I often found myself not just playing games, but also tinkering with both the
            hardware and software components, seeking to understand their inner workings. This early exposure laid a solid
            foundation for my pursuit of a career in software engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I consider myself a creative individual. I highly value creativity and actively
            engage in various hobbies that nurture this trait. My interests include video editing, graphic design, and drawing—skills
            I apply in both traditional and digital formats. For instance, I have volunteered as a logo designer for a dormitory, where
            I had the opportunity to merge my artistic vision with practical application. Furthermore, I create engaging content on
            platforms such as YouTube, which not only fuels my creativity but also serves to enhance my technical skills within my
            field of study.
        </p>

        <p>
            These hobbies align perfectly with my aspiration to become an indie game developer. My passion for video
            games, particularly those rich in storytelling, drives my ambition. I envision a future where I can create my own games,
            encompassing unique designs, intricate narratives, and promotional materials, all while coding the game myself. I am
            eager to share my vision and creations with the world, contributing to the vibrant landscape of indie gaming.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I am confident in my abilities and creative pursuits, I also recognize my areas for improvement. One
            challenge I face is my tendency to be less sociable and my struggle with effective communication. I understand that in
            the field of game development, networking and collaboration are essential components for success. To address this, I
            am actively seeking ways to enhance my sociability and engage with others more effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I embark on this journey, I am filled with enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead. I am confident
            that my strengths, along with my commitment to personal and professional growth, will guide my interactions and
            decisions. My journey is far from over, and I am eager to continue learning, expanding my skills, and making meaningful
            contributions to the world around me. I look forward to embracing the challenges and opportunities that await, as I
            strive to leave a positive impact in both my community and the broader field of software engineering.
